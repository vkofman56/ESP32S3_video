# Preparing SD Card image for GS from prebuilt image

* Download prebuilt image from release https://github.com/RomanLut/hx-esp32-cam-fpv/releases  (choose correct image - for RPI or Radxa Zero 3W)

* Write image to SD Card using **Raspberry Pi Imager** https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
 
   *Choose "Custom OS"...*

* If dualboot image is unable to load correct drivers for wifi cards, boot into **RubyFPV** (by holding **REC GS** button on boot) and select **Factory Reset** in **RubyFPV** menu.

* *Not for dualboot image*: Let it boot once into GS software or user prompt. Sometimes it can boot into user prompt on very first boot because wlan0 and wlan1 get allocated in incorrect order. If it happends - just reboot, it should correctly boot into GS software.
